# Operations Management Suite Agent for Linux Public Preview
## Overview
Welcome to the OMS Agent for Linux Preview! The OMS Agent for Linux enables rich and real-time analytics for operational data from Linux servers using Operations Management Suite.

Our goal for this preview is to get your feedback on onboarding the agent, configuring data to be collected, and your general experience using OMS with Linux data. We rely on your feedback to improve both design and implementation of these features. As this is a preview, the feature set is subject to change and should not be considered production ready.

*Note: the features and supported Linux versions in this Technical Preview are a limited subset of planned capabilities*
